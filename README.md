# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Game that we play in our childhood based on Python. Here we have 3 file:

1. TicTacToe_2Player.py: A simple 2 player mode Tic Tac Toe game.

2. TicTacToe_with_DumbPC.py: Single player mode with PC in which PC's step is generated by random() of randome library.

3. TicTacToe_Using-Neural-Network.ipynb: Single player mode with PC in which PC improves its game by learning. It utilizes a deep learning framework like TensorFlow. a neural network model using TensorFlow with a simple architecture consisting of fully connected layers. The build_model method sets up the model architecture, and the get_state method converts the board state into a numerical representation. In the computer_turn method, the neural network model predicts the Q-values for the current state, and based on an exploration-exploitation strategy, the computer player (O) selects the move with the highest Q-value among the valid moves. The selected move is then made on the board, and the game progresses.

Additionally, the update_q_values method updates the Q-values based on the game outcome and performs model fitting to train the neural network. The play_game method handles the main game loop and integrates the neural network-based computer player into the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

With this implementation, the neural network learns to make optimal moves through reinforcement learning and improves its performance over time.

NOTE: Ay improvement in Neural Network is welcome. I need suggestion and more advice.
